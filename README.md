# SDEVFinalProject
This is the SDEV final project with the ice cream customizer using tkinter in python.

Description: The application will ask the user to pick either a cone, bowl, or a taco as their dish.
The application will then ask the user how many scoops of ice cream they would like and then what flavor. 
The application will then ask them what toppings they would want on their ice cream and 
finally it will give you the option to order your ice cream and give you the pricings with it.

Uses tkinter and tkinter.font libraries

The Ice-Creamations - Matthew Hornbach.py file is the finished program.
